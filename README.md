# Machine-Learning-Models-On-Iris-DataSet
 Implementing Different Machine Learning Algorithms like:
 1.Logistic Regression (LR).
 2.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
 3.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
 4.Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
 5.Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
 6.Support Vector Machines (SVM).
were applied on the well known IRIS dataset.
The models were implemented using sci-kit learn standard libraries and K-fold cross evaluation was done to train the models. 
Then the best performing model was chosen and applied on a held out validation set and its performance was measured.
